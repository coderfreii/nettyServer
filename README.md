# nettyServer
this repository is meant for knowing how stream media server works

this project is based on red5 ,  for learning purpose I decide to migrate it from mina to netty which I prefer to and familiar with.

there are still a few left things need to work with, but it basiclly shows its full form now, and should work properly with a little ajustment.
